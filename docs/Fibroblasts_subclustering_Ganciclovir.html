and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.

The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/GinoBonazza/EAM/tree/4d26809837697a4027e13e2bdcbfc8f824195fcf" target="_blank">4d26809</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
